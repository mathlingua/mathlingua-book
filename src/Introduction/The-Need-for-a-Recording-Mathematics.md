# The Need for a Recording Mathematics


There are many examples in mathematics of concepts being rediscovered.  This could be from the fact that it is often times difficult to find what has already been discovered.  This is compounded by the observation that different authors can use very different nomenclature and notation for the same concepts.

Further, as more and more mathematics is discovered, it is becoming harder and harder for any individual to follow everything new.  This is especially difficult since many discoveries may be in journals that are hard to search and require subscriptions, and thus are not accessible to most.

As a result, a standard repository of all mathematics in a clear, consistent format is needed to help this and future generations discover and record mathematics.
