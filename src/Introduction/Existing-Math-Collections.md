# Existing Math Collections


Existing collections of mathematical knowledge typically fall into two categories.  First are books, articles, journals, encyclopedias, etc. while the second are collections written in theorem proving languages such as Lean, Coq, Mizar, etc.

For the first category, different math concepts can be spread across different books or other resources.  Even for encyclopedias, nomenclature and notation can vary across the encyclopedia.

Next, these resources are written in natural language, and are thus difficult for computers to search and understand.  That is, it is not easy to make computer search capabilities to search math books, journals, and encyclopedias and find, for example, all theorems that describe when a function is measurable.

Further, mathematics written in natural language can be imprecise and difficult to read because statements can rely on context or conventions for information.  For example, a theorem might say for all $x$ and $y$ there exists an $n$ such that $x*n > y$, where it is up to the reader to infer, based on convention and the fact that the theorem is in a real analysis book, that $x$ and $y$ refer to real numbers and $n$ an integer.

Last, mathematics written in natural language do not have any automated checking of any aspects of the statements.  In particular, a statement could have a typo in a symbol name, thus using a name that is not defined anywhere or refer to a definition that doesn't exist, and it is up to manual review to catch those mistakes.

In the second category,
