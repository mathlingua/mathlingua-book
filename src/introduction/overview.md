# Mathlingua

Today there is so much mathematical knowledge in existence in the form of definitions,
axioms, theorems, and conjectures, that it can be hard to know  or discover what is
known and what is unknown.

Suppose you want to find all theorems that describe Cauchy sequences or all definitions
of functions that have a specific property.  It is very difficult to answer such
questions with traditional journals, books, encyclopedias, and other sources.

Mathlingua is a language designed to precisely describe mathematical knowledge in such a
way that a knowledgebase encoded in MathLingua is easy for people and computers to read,
write, and understand the meaning of the mathematical statement described.

That is, typically encyclopedias, books, and journals record mathematics using natural
languages such that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for a computer to
understand the meaning of the mathematics described in the encyclopedia.

That is, one can search for the definition of a group in current enclyclopedias, journals,
and books etc.  However, one cannot easily search for all definitions of mathematical
constructs that extend the idea of a group to include more requirements.

The purpose of MathLingua is to build an encyclopedia of mathematics specifically designed
to record mathematics in such a way that computers can understand the meaning of the
mathematics recorded to be able to answer such questions.
