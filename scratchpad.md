=========================================================


- Usage of formulation language and structural language
- Is vs viewed as
  - describe how extends and means work
- Resolution
  - describe how it is determine if a name satsifies a param
  - forms must comply
  - describe how (a, b, c) looks at how something that in `is`
    statements are searched to determine if (a, b, c) is something
  - Describe how first look at entity, then extends:/means;, and then
    any viewed:as:
- Ids
  - Types of sigils
    - People, Resources, Specify, Definitions, Results
  - use of := and nesting and forms
  - use of [x]{x | ...} vs {{x | p(x)}}
  - use of [x]{f(x)} vs {f(x)}
  - variadic args
  - signatures
  - @[...]
  - prefix vs infix
- People
  - Description of sigil
- Resources
  - Description of sigil
  - offset
- Types of arguments
  - Target
    - :=
    - names
    - sets
    - functions
    - tuples
  - Specification
  - Statement
  - Expression
- Static vs Non-static items
  - Static items:
    - is, as, extends
    - operators that are :->
    - States that only use static items
  - Non-static items:
    - All others including = and := and :=>
- Commands
  - Infix vs prefix
  - Structure (name.name:name:name)
  - the meaning of () vs {}
  - if () is used it must be a f() form
- Provides
  - Dynamic operators
    - :-> for specifications
    - :=> for expressions
    - Explain how they are dynamically resolved
      - Resolution algorithm for x op y
    - Destructuring
      - [G.*] vs G.1
  - Views
    - describe what viewing as means
    - describe view as different form
    - describe functor description
- := and =
- Dynamic operators and infix operators
  - Differences
  - When to use one vs the other
  - How dynamic operators can have when: sections
- Literals
  - How specify specifies how literals are treated
- Variable shadowing
  - How variables are resolved
  - Aliases
- Meta types
  - [:a|b|c:]
- Clauses
  - if:then:
  - iff:then:
  - exists:...
  - ...
- Labels
  - \[] references a signature
  - \[]::() references a label in another entity
  - \() references a label in the same entity
  - how names must not contain spaces (use dots)
- Referencews
- Documented section
  - called vs written vs writing
- Metadata
  - id
- Rendering
  - x? variadic forms
  - x?, x-?, x+?
  - called: and written: both not needed
    describe how they are inferrred
